		<section id="body-text"><img src="http://cdn1.sciencefiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Jurassic-World.jpg" alt="T-Rex from Jurassic World">Colin Trevorrow has revealed the original Jurassic Park T. Rex makes an appearance in the sequel Jurassic World. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard star in the latest instalment of the hit movie franchise. And Colin, who helms the highly-anticipated sequel, has revealed that one of the most famous creatures from the original 1993 movie will be returning to the big screen.</section>

		<section id="quote-text"><p>"The T. Rex that's in the film is the T. Rex from the original Jurassic Park," Colin told Slash Film. "She is 22 years older. But she's not limping around. We took the original design and obviously, technology has changed. So, it's going to move a little bit differently, but it'll move differently because it's older. And we're giving her some scars and we're tightening her skin. So, she has that feeling of, like, an older Burt Lancaster. And this movie is her Unforgiven."</p></section>

		<section id="body-text"><p>Despite Jurassic Park being 22 years old, the special effects have stood the test of time. However, Colin says the team on the new movie used all the available technology at their disposal to ensure Jurassic World is the best it could be.</p></section>
